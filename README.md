# Smart File Organizer

A desktop app I built to clean up messy folders automatically.
Tired of having hundreds of random files in Downloads, so I made this.

## What it does

- Scans any folder you pick
- Groups files into categories: Images, Videos, Audio, PDFs, Docs, Code, Archives, Executables
- Shows you a **preview** of what will move before anything happens
- Moves everything into clean subfolders with one click

## Requirements

```
PyQt5
```

Install with:

```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

## Run

```bash
python smart_organizer.py
```

## How it works

1. Click **Browse** → pick your folder (e.g. Downloads)
2. Click **Scan** → see all files grouped by type
3. Click any file → preview panel shows where it'll go
4. Click **Organize** → confirm, and files get moved

Name collisions are handled automatically (adds `_1`, `_2`, etc.).

## Supported file types

| Category | Extensions |
|---|---|
| Images | jpg, png, gif, svg, webp... |
| Videos | mp4, mkv, avi, mov... |
| Audio | mp3, wav, flac, aac... |
